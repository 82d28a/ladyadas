1. Watch Video and Read about how humans see color.

2. Read watch what are neopixils a.k.a. RGB LEDs

Libraries in python and in most programming languages, are a collection of written programs that allow you to save time and simplify your programs.  Someone in the AdaFruit company wrote libraries to use all of the gadgets on your CPE. We will be using them to write our programs. The "import" word tells python that we are using those libraries. **Those libraries are already on you CPE, under the "lib" folder. 



Create a new script called "code.py" using PyCharm.

# This line imports libraries that allows access to the neopixels on our board
import board 

# This line imports libraries that are used to simply show any color on our neopixils, we have 10!
import neopixel

# This line imports everything to do with time. We will use it to control how much time to light up the neopixils.  
"time.sleep(secs)" Suspend execution of the current thread for the given number of seconds. The argument may be a floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep time. The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal will terminate the sleep() following execution of that signal’s catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system. https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html
import time

# this line creates an object called pixels. You could have named the object whatever you wanted like “rainbow_lites” but we used pixels.   Here is where we use previously written code we imported above. “neopixel” is the library name and the specific program we want to use is called “NeoPixel” confusing? This program needs additional configuration or settings to make it work properly. First setting is the where the neopixels are found, which we reference another library “board.NEOPIXEL”.  The second arguement is “10” which tell how many neopixls there are. The last argument is how bright 1 being brightest and 0 being off. 

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 10, brightness=.2)
# This line sets the color to 0,0,0 which is black or off
pixels.fill((0,0,0))
# This line tell the board to show the colors. 
pixels.show()




Step one write down your plan or your goals! 
1. What colors do you want on the 10 neopixils?
2. Do you want them to blink?
3. Do you want them to bright or dull?

Calculate the colors using 3 bytes:
1. Use below website and note down values for your color: http://htmlcolorcodes.com/
2. Create your tuples. Example: (255,255,0) * Each one of the 3 integers represents one byte, that is why it is limited from 0-255

Try to program the following:
Red, Green, Blue
Purple, Pink, Yellow
White, Orange…

Challenge: How would you cycle the rainbow?

Things to try at home, with your parents: 
1. Try to make each of the 10 pixels a different colors.  HINT, look at the other example codes.
2. Try adding a button to turn on and off the pixels.
3. Be creative and make someting great!

Reference for Buttons/Switches:
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-digital-in-out

# Setup button A
button_a = DigitalInOut(board.BUTTON_A)
button_a.direction = Direction.INPUT
button_a.pull = Pull.DOWN
