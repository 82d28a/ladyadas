How to measure accelration with our CPE:

1. Try out the code and see note how the CPE measures 3 axis of motion.

2. Your goal for today is to trigger a change in color, tone of sound, or playing a .wav file based on measured x,y, and z axis acceleration.  You will use if, elif, else conditional statements to trigger them. 

Things to try at home:
* Hint here is to record the measurements of the act before you can program the trigger.   
1. Make a sound and light alarm for your books to detect if anyone moved your super secret book or package.
2. Create a step counter that flashes lights or beeps or counts as you take a step.
