# This first line gets you access to the physical button. You could name "button_b" to whatever you want.
button_b = DigitalInOut(board.BUTTON_B)

# This line tells the CPE to use the button as input, this is obvious.
button_b.direction = Direction.INPUT

# This set the initial state to False or down.
button_b.pull = Pull.DOWN



# This first line gets you access to the physical slide switch. You could name "slide_switch" to whatever you want.
slide_switch = DigitalInOut(board.SLIDE_SWITCH)

# This line tells the CPE to use the button as input, this is obvious.
slide_switch.direction = Direction.INPUT

# This set the initial state to True or UP.
slide_switch.pull = Pull.UP


Create a loop to check if button_b is True or False. If true show some pretty colors!
Create a loop to check if slide_switch is True or False(slide to left or right). If true make the leds be dim, if false make it bright!
