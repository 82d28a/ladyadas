Take a look at this video to review how colors work on just about all smart phones, computer screens and TV screens you use everyday!

# This line should be added to the top of your program to use the digitalio python library. Remember libraries are a collection of programs that someone already wrote for you to reuse.  We use this library to access the butttons!
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull

# This first line gets you access to the physical button. You could name "button_b" to whatever you want.
button_b = DigitalInOut(board.BUTTON_B)

# This line tells the CPE to use the button as input, this is obvious.
button_b.direction = Direction.INPUT

# This set the initial state to False or down.
button_b.pull = Pull.DOWN


Create a loop to check if button_b is True or False. If true show some pretty colors!
    Create a function that shows all red.
    Create a function that shows all blue.
        Hint:
            def function_name:
            <tab>put your code here to show all blue or red.

    Use "while True:" to create an infinite loop.
        Check for buttons for press.
            Then do something like calling your function that creates all red shiny lights! 
            
        Don't forget to put a delay here to make your gizmo wait a few tenths of seconds before checking the switch.


Try this at home with your parents:
    
    Create a loop to check if slide_switch is True or False(slide to left or right). If true make the leds be dim, if false make it bright!  

# This line should be added to the top of your program to use the digitalio python library. Remember libraries are a collection of programs that someone already wrote for you to reuse.  We use this library to access the butttons and slide switches!
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull

# This first line gets you access to the physical slide switch. You could name "slide_switch" to whatever you want.
slide_switch = DigitalInOut(board.SLIDE_SWITCH)

# This line tells the CPE to use the button as input, this is obvious.
slide_switch.direction = Direction.INPUT

# This set the initial state to True or UP.
slide_switch.pull = Pull.UP
