How does the light sensor work?
http://education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/content/electronics/boe/light_sensor/1.html


Today we will learn how to use the light sensor.  We will use the example code to see how the sensor works. Then we will modify the code to turn on the light or make a sound. 

1. Find the light sensor on your CPE.  HINT: Look through the other labs for links to labeled diagram of CPE.

2. Copy and run the the example code for the light sensor.  https://learn.adafruit.com/sensor-plotting-with-mu-and-circuitpython/light NOTE: Our version of MU doesn't have the graphing so you will only see numbers. 

3. Read through the code and try changing a few numbers to see what happens. Why would you want to change this number? HINT: There only one!

4. Use conditional statements "if,elif, and else" with the light sensor value to create a smart home switch. Try a very simple example first. Try playing a beep or turning on an LED when the light is low. If you get stuck look at previous lab code. 

Project Ideas to try at home:
  * A night light that turns on when you turn off the lights and turns on in the morning.
  * Refridgerator light detector to prove that the refridgerator light turns off when you close it. 
  * A reading light that adjusts to the ambiant light so you get just the right amount of light. 
  * Sunrise wake up alarm.
  * Sunny to cloudy day sunscreen recommender.
