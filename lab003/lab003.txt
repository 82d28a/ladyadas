Todays Project is to created a program that will change NeoPixil colors based on the temperature.
Lady Adas was asked by Sisters of North America (SNA) to create a lie detecter for their siblings being sick.
Your gizmo needs to change colors based on the temperature of your sibling!
Pick 4 temperature ranges and assign simple colors. 
Research what is "normal" or healthy temperature.

1. Temperature range too cold be to normal.
2. Perfectly fine Temp, sibling not sick!
3. Has a fever and needs to stay home from school.
4. Tell mom and dad to take your siblings to the hospital.
