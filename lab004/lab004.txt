Define random or entropy? Are computers random?

Today we will learn how to make CPE listen for sound using the built in microphone and play sounds using a SIN wave or .WAV files.
We will also learn about the micropython random libraries  and how we can use it to create R2-D2 or BB-8 like sounds.



Option 1 Goal:
    Create a program that listens to sounds when at a certain volume, then CPE will respond by playing a random frequency SIN wave beeps and show random color lights.
    Example: I can say "Roberto Clemente" which is at volume level above N value you set. Then the program will wait a few milliseconds to mimic human conversation pattern and play random beeps and repeat.



Option 2 Goal:
    Create a program that listens to sounds when at a certain volume, then CPE will respond by playing a random StarWars sound clip.
    Example: I can say "Hello, R2D2" which is at volume level above N value you set. Then the program will wait a few milliseconds to mimic human conversation pattern and play a random StarWars .wav file and repeat.
