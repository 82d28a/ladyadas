  NOTE: You do not need to do the setup portions, I already did that for you all. You can skip to setting up the REPL and trying out the code. In the walk through *THE BLINK EXAMPLE does not work, and other example code may NOT WORK WITH CIRCUIT PLAYGROUND EXPRESS!!!



Reset Python firmware: ** If you forget to eject disk before disconnecting the USB, the circuitpy file system may get corrupted. You can tell when this happens if you have problems creating new/changing/deleting files on the drive. Also sometimes existing files will be empty. If you experience any of this just follow directions in link below, under "File system issues". The u2f file reference is under core_files.
